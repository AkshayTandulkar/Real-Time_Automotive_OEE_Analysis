# Real-Time Overall Equipement Effeciency(OEE) Analysis for Automotive Domain
__Real-time__ performance optimization project encompassing a comprehensive streaming __data pipeline__ with __data collection, persistence, preparation, processing, analysis, and visualization__ using __AWS services__

* __Reference__ : "AWS Data-Driven Everything(D2E) Workshop - Chicago"

### Project Objective

An automotive manufacturing company aims to become world class in manufacturing operations. In order to achieve this objective each machine in the factory should achieve Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) of 85% or above. OEE is the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) we would track to improve the Overall Operating Efficiency. OEE looks at the cumulative efficiency of machine over time. It focuses on the amount of total units produced against how many of those are considered defects.The company has found that they are close to this operating target but suspect there are certain machines that needs a repair.

* __Part A__ : As a Data Engineer we will store the historical manufacturing data. Then we will create a Glue database to catalog the data. As a Data Analyst we will clean the historical dataset using AWS Glue DataBrew Job.

* __Architecture__

* __Part B__: Live streaming raw data is managed using AWS Kinesis Data Streams, AWS Glue Streaming and persisted in an S3 bucket. The data is cleaned and stored in another S3 bucket.
 Then we will create a Glue database to catalog the data. This is further used by AWS Redshift Serverless for processing and querying. This data is then visualized using Amazon Quicksight, monitored by the Factory Manager.
 
* __Part C__: AWS lambda is used to trigger AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) if OEE KPI is breached below 85%. The line operator gets real time notification to take further action accordingly.

### Dataset Attributes

```
line - the factory line id
line_description - description of the type of vehicle parts are made on the line.
operator_name - last name, first name of the employee operating the machine at the time of data entry.
operator_perno - HR personel number of the employee.
assembly_id - vehicle part number being assembled.
machine_model_no - model number of the manufacturing machine.
machine_manufacturer_id - unique id of the specific machine ( concatenation line+machine).
machine - the machine location on a given line
machine_description - description of the area of the vehicle in which the machine is assemblying for.
units_target - target number of units to be produced for a shift.
timestamp - time at which the event was recorded.
wire_tension - amount of tension for the machine's wire (in newtons), this wire helps with assembly.
power_unit - amount of power being generated by the machine (0-100) in kilowatts.
error_code - code of error being produced at the moment.
bit_speed - how fast the machine's rotating bit (to power the machine) is spinning in revolutions per minute (R.P.M).
temperature - the current temperature of the machine in celsius.
units - current number of units produced (the machine has the ability to track when a full unit is produced, allowing a decimal to be shown between each full unit).
defective_count - amount of defects produced at the given time (shown as a decimal but can be converted to a percentage).
```

 ### Data Cleaning
 
 Steps to be followed on AWS Glue DataBrew:
 
 __1.__ Redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Here __operator_name__ and __operator_perno__ columns needs to be redacted.
 
 __2.__ Sort the data in ascending order by __timestamp__
